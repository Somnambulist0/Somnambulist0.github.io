<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>
I am a Master’s student in Computer Science at Brown University. 

Previously, I completed my undergraduate studies with distinction in Computer Science at Duke Kunshan University and Duke University (2021–2025), where I had the privilege of being advised by [Prof. Kaizhu Huang](https://sites.google.com/view/kaizhu-huang-homepage). 

In the summer of 2024, I spent an enriching time at [Yale Vision Lab](https://vision.cs.yale.edu/) under the guidance of [Prof. Alex Wong](https://vision.cs.yale.edu/members/alex-wong.html).

During the fall 2023 term, I had a wonderful experience at Duke University, where I worked as a research assistant [Duke University I3T Lab](https://maria.gorlatova.com/), under the supervision of [Prof. Maria Gorlatova](https://maria.gorlatova.com/bio/).

***Research Interests***: I aim to investigate 3D reconstruction, perception, and generation, with an interest in leveraging multimodal inputs to assist in vision tasks. I am also passionate about designing efficient visual systems that can enable embodied agents to better understand and interact with the physical world while addressing real-world challenges.
