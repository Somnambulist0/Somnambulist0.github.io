<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a senior undergraduate student in Applied Mathematics and Computational Science at Duke Kunshan University (2021 - 2025). 
I have the privilege of being advised by [Prof. Kaizhu Huang](https://sites.google.com/view/kaizhu-huang-homepage). 

Previously, I spent an enriching summer at [Yale Vision Lab](https://vision.cs.yale.edu/) under the guidance of [Prof. Alex Wong](https://vision.cs.yale.edu/members/alex-wong.html). \\
During the fall term of 2023, I had a wonderful time at Duke University, where I worked as a research assistant in the [Duke University I3T Lab](https://maria.gorlatova.com/), 
advised by [Prof. Maria Gorlatova](https://maria.gorlatova.com/bio/).

My research interests primarily focus on 3D Vision, encompassing Reconstruction, Perception, and Generation.
